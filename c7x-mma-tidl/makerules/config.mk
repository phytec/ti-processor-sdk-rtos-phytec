# TARGET_PLATFORM      :  Used to select the target platform. PC(Host emulation) or the TI device.
# TARGET_CPU           :  Used select Particular TI compute core. This applicable in PC emulation
#                         mode as well to select the Host emulation packages
# TARGET_BUILD         :  used to select Debug or Release build

# TIDL_BUILD_FOR_LOKI  :  Temporary flag. Will be removed once VLAB simulator matures.

#
# Example usages
# 1. Build for C7x Target : gmake or  gmake TARGET_PLATFORM=TI_DEVICE TARGET_CPU=C71
